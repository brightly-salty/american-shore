With the retirement of longtime establishment congressman Bobby Rush. It’s been obvious for a while that the Democratic field to be his successor is going to be pretty large, and could produce an interesting race that'll have the elites listening. The race features alderman Pat Dowell, a key member of the Chicago Democratic Machine. Then there's Karin Norington-Reaves, the handpicked replacement of Rush. Nortigon-Reves apparently knew that Rush was retiring prior to his announcement, which shows us that this was all planned out, which is contrary to Rush's statements of being "undecided" on whether to retire. Unsuprising.  Aside from those interesting two, there's a whole list of people running the generic Democrat campaign on "bringing hope" But again, more horse-jockey. While the victor of this primary is likely to win the general (IL-1 is VERY Democratic) There are also Republicans. You would think they would concede some policy to at least be a credible opponent, but no. You got Philanse White, who stood on the same stage as Rod Blagojevich in a "Chicago For Trump Rally" Another GOP candidate is Eric Carlson, he's not much different, except he's seem to have distanced himself from Trump a bit more.

But what intrigues us the most is an independent candidate, Mitch Davilo. Davilo is a life-long resident of Chicago who is not a politician, but a worker. He may show up as an independent, but he is affiliated with the United States Pirate Party. His candidate page states "I’m running as a member of the United States Pirate Party because they allow me to be the most honest candidate I can be. I can fight for people & defend human rights, without worrying about upholding status quo and riding party lines. I’m a worker, I work for other workers." He is running not on a liberal platform or a conservative platform, but a mix of both. He seeks to have tax choice, essentially if you don't wanna send taxpayer dollars to endless wars, you don't have to. The jist is that you should be able to chose where your tax dollars go, not some random insider in DC. Davilo also discusses his support of the right to bear arms, citing the need to defend yourself.

Going towards the more left wing of things, Davilo supports ending the drug war which have plauged many communities and have led to massive incarnation rates.

And we must note that IL-1 has been represented by the Dems for a LONG time, and the district has gotten the same old thing every time.

Surprisingly, the district once was known for having representatives who speaked of bold ideas. Elihu B. Washburne was one of then. Washburne was an ardent opponent of slavery and an original supporter of racial equality. He even supported splitting up plantations and giving into the slaves! 

Peraps Davilo can follow Washburnes legacy of principle and independent thinking and have an electoral upset, or maybe the district will stay in the hands of the Democratic Machine. Remember folks, stay informed and never be afraid to speak out.
