Ahoy, my friends. I come to you today with the betterment of the world in mind, I come to you to shine light on what has been swept away by many. When you think of the PATRIOT Act, many think of the illegal surveillance and violation of rights, which is absolutely true, but, we are missing one key detail. The impact and discriminatory policies it enforces on muslims, such as I. For starters, the Inspector General of the United States provides a PATRIOT Act complaint hotline, but  “it also happens to be” that the majority of the complaints come from Muslims and Arabs. As many of you may know, Japanese immigrants were commonly denied citizenship because they were profiled as “not being loyal” to the United States during World War 2. Today, we stand at a similar crossroads. It must be noted that due to the PATRIOT Act and other anti-muslim sentiment, Hate crimes against Muslims are on the rise, In 2001, as per the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program, 481 hate crimes towards Muslim and Arab Americans were reported. 

This represents a significant increase above the 28 instances documented in 2000. The PATRIOT Act is also being used as an excuse by institutions to blacklist Muslim accounts because their names happen to be similar to those on the governments surveillance lists. Unfortunately, in Politics there exists a Team Red and Team Blue, but on Government surveillance and restricting people's civil liberties, they’re on the same team. But the Pirate Party knows America can do better, and we can. The Pirate Party, a party of the liberated free supports devoting more resources to helping targets of racial profiling get access to justice and to hold perpetrators accountable, they support  institutitng programs to eliminate profiling, and require national data collection programs on the race or ethnicity, religion, and gender of individuals stopped. That is something no other Political Party in the United States offers, and that’s why the Pirate Party gives muslims like me, a safe roof to be under.
